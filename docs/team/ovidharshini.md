### Project: PeopleSoft

PeopleSoft is a CLI-based payroll management app for companies handling contractor-based services.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Display of an overview of commands on the HelpWindow page
    * What it does: Allow for the display of messages from all command classes on a singular UI component.
    * Justification: In previous iterations, the HelpWindow contained a button that linked to the user guide on Github. While this technically fits the wording of the `help` command provided in the user guide, displaying the commands directly would be more user-friendly.
      * Highlights: A previous implementation was considered following the implementation for `Person` with similar `CommandHelpMessageCard` and `CommandHelpMessageListPanel` classes. TableView was selectively chosen over this implementation given its relative ease of use. 
    * Credits: [Amos Chepchieng from Medium](https://medium.com/@keeptoo/adding-data-to-javafx-tableview-stepwise-df582acbae4f) for populating TableView with data programmatically
